# Augment-Agent Memory Log

## Phase2-Start - 2025-05-28 15:39 UTC

# Memory Integration Phase 2 - Starting Development

## Current Status (2025-05-28 15:38 UTC)
- ✅ Successfully transitioned from Phase 1 to Phase 2
- ✅ Created work-0.3.4-2 branch and tested development tooling
- ✅ Git configuration fixed (using GitHub noreply email)
- ✅ Development snapshot created and committed

## Phase 1 Completion Summary
From previous memory files:
- Memory sync hotkeys implemented (4 new hotkeys)
- Development tooling enhanced with quick_commit_push, auto_commit_memory, test_tooling
- Settings integration completed (memory_file setting)
- Circular import issue identified between sqlite_memory.py and memory_sync.py

## Phase 2 Objectives
1. Resolve circular import issues with lazy loading pattern
2. Test memory sync operations with actual Git commands  
3. Create integration tests for memory sync workflow
4. Hook memory sync into agent initialization/completion workflows

## Next Actions
- Implement lazy loading for MemorySyncManager in sqlite_memory.py
- Test memory sync hotkeys end-to-end
- Create comprehensive integration tests
