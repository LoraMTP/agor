# Memory-Integration Memory Log

## Progress - 2025-05-28 15:16 UTC

# Memory System Integration - Phase 1 Complete

## Session Summary (2025-05-28 15:16:32 UTC)

### Major Accomplishments
1. **Enhanced Development Tooling**
   - Created comprehensive dev_tooling.py with robust import handling
   - Added timestamp utilities (NTP, file-safe, precise)
   - Implemented test_tooling() function for session validation
   - Updated development guide with tooling requirements

2. **Memory Sync Hotkeys Implementation**
   - Added 4 new memory sync hotkeys to sqlite_hotkeys.py:
     * mem-sync-start - Initialize memory branch and sync
     * mem-sync-save - Save current memory state
     * mem-sync-restore - Restore from memory branch
     * mem-sync-status - Show synchronization status
   - All hotkeys properly registered (14 total SQLite hotkeys)
   - Updated help documentation

3. **Settings Integration**
   - Added MEMORY_FILE setting to settings.py
   - Updated memory_sync.py to use proper settings
   - Aligned with AGOR settings architecture

4. **Import Issue Resolution**
   - Identified circular import between memory_sync.py and sqlite_memory.py
   - Temporarily disabled MemorySyncManager integration
   - Maintained functionality while preventing import errors

### Current Status
- ✅ Memory sync hotkeys fully implemented and registered
- ✅ Development tooling enhanced and tested
- ✅ Settings configuration integrated
- ⚠️ Circular import needs resolution for full functionality

### Next Phase Requirements
1. Implement lazy loading pattern for MemorySyncManager
2. Test memory sync operations with actual Git commands
3. Create integration tests for memory sync workflow
4. Hook into agent initialization/completion workflows

### Technical Notes
- Memory sync uses Git branches with prefix: agor/mem/
- SQLite hotkey registry now contains 14 commands
- Development tooling includes fallback git binary support
- All changes committed to branch: work-0.3.4-1

### For Next Agent
- Memory system architecture is complete
- Integration hotkeys are implemented
- Focus on resolving circular imports and testing
- Use test_tooling() at session start to validate environment
