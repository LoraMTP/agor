# AgentOrchestrator (AGOR) - Bundle Mode Instructions

## Bundle Mode for ChatGPT Upload

**Bundle Mode** is for AI platforms that work with file uploads (currently ChatGPT).

### Step 1: Install AGOR Locally

```bash
# Install using pipx (recommended)
pipx install agor

# Or using pip
pip install agor
```

### Step 2: Bundle Your Project

```bash
# Bundle all branches (default)
agor bundle /path/to/your/project

# Bundle only main/master branch
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -m

# Bundle main/master + specific branches
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -b feature1,feature2
```

### Step 3: Upload to ChatGPT

1. **Upload the .tar.gz file** to ChatGPT using the file upload button
2. **Copy and paste the prompt** that AGOR generated
3. **ChatGPT will extract** the bundle and initialize AGOR protocol

### Step 4: Begin Coordination

ChatGPT will transform into AgentOrchestrator with access to:

- Your complete project codebase
- AGOR planning and coordination tools
- Multi-agent prompt templates
- Strategic planning frameworks

## Bundle Mode vs Agent Mode

**Bundle Mode (This Mode) - For Upload-Based AI Platforms:**

- **Requires local installation** - user installs AGOR locally
- **File upload workflow** - user bundles project and uploads .tar.gz
- **Works with upload-only platforms** like ChatGPT
- **Self-contained** - everything bundled in one file
- **For**: ChatGPT and other platforms without git access

**Agent Mode - For AI Agents with Git Access:**

- **No installation required** - just clone the AGOR repository
- **Direct repository access** - can work with any repository URL
- **No file size limitations** - full repository access
- **Real-time updates** - can pull latest AGOR improvements
- **For**: Augment Code, Jules by Google, other advanced AI agents

## Bundle Contents

When you create a bundle, AGOR includes:

1. **Your project files** with git history and branch information
2. **AGOR tools** - All coordination and analysis tools
3. **Git binary** - Portable git for ChatGPT environment
4. **AI instructions** - Complete protocol for ChatGPT to follow

## Troubleshooting

### Large Repository Issues

If your repository is very large:

```bash
# Bundle only main branch to reduce size
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -m

# Or bundle specific branches only
agor bundle /path/to/your/project -b main,develop
```

### Upload Limits

- ChatGPT has file size limits for uploads
- Use branch selection to reduce bundle size
- Consider using Agent Mode for very large projects

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Install AGOR
pipx install agor

# 2. Bundle your project
agor bundle ~/my-project

# 3. Upload my-project.tar.gz to ChatGPT

# 4. Paste the generated prompt

# 5. ChatGPT becomes AgentOrchestrator and analyzes your project
```
